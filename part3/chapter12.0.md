# The Future of Data Systems
So far, this book has been mostly about describing things as they are at present. In this final chapter, we will shift our perspective toward the future and discuss how things should be: I will propose some ideas and approaches that, I believe, may funda‐ mentally improve the ways we design and build applications.

The goal of this book was outlined in Chapter 1: to explore how to create applications and systems that are reliable, scalable, and maintainable. These themes have run through all of the chapters: for example, we discussed many fault-tolerance algo‐ rithms that help improve reliability, partitioning to improve scalability, and mecha‐ nisms for evolution and abstraction that improve maintainability. In this chapter we will bring all of these ideas together, and build on them to envisage the future. Our goal is to discover how to design applications that are better than the ones of today— robust, correct, evolvable, and ultimately beneficial to humanity.
