# Binary Strings

Binary string data types represent sequences of binary data, typically used to store and manipulate binary information like images, files, or any data that doesn't conform to regular text encoding. Unlike regular text strings, which are composed of characters encoded in a specific character set (like UTF-8), binary strings allow for the storage of raw binary data.

In programming, these data types are often employed when dealing with files, networking protocols, or situations where data needs to be handled at a low level without any implicit character encoding. They enable precise manipulation of bits and bytes, offering a more flexible approach for working with non-textual data.

A binary string is a sequence of bytes. Unlike character strings, which usually contain text data, binary strings are used to hold data such as pictures, voice, or mixed media.
